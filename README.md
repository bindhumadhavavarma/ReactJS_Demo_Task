<h1>React JS Demo Task</h1>
This is the repository for the demo task given as part of the react js interview. <br>
The website can be experienced at <a href="https://bindhumadhav.in/react_demo">bindhumadhav.in/react_demo</a>
<hr>
The description of the task given are listed below :
<ul>
<li>Fetch team data from a backend server.</li>
<li>Develop a search bar that automatically filters the team with every change</li>
<li>The search bar must have two search parameters Name and Role</li>
</ul>
<hr>
The approach i followed to fullfill the given tasks are :
<ul>
<li>For backend <b>FireBase</b> was used and data is fetched every time the page is loaded.</li>
<li>With every change in the searchbar a filtration is done in the fetched data locally instead of fetching data again to optimize search times.</li>
<li>A selection box is provided to switch between search parameters</li>
</ul>
